Currently, the program wrap the text into 5 words blocks, query them to google and check whether it produced a "did you mean". However it still doesn't subtitute the suggestion for the original excerpt.
In the middle of the project I found out that google provides only 100 queries per day  which isn't quite enough for me (if you need more than this you need to pay A LOT) and, hence, I've been looking for free alternative search engines, leaving this project in standby for now.
